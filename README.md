# CSS-deaths

An analysis of deaths due to stroke, cardiovascular and coronary heart disease is performed.  The data for this investigation was obtained in the form of two excel files from the Office National Statistics
 and saved in the  "data" directory as "ccs.xls" and "pop_stand_2012_eng.xls"  in this repository. The former contains details of CSS caused deaths, and the latter contains the population count for England and Wales beginning 2012.  
 
The software utilised for analysis and graphics was R. The RMarkdown files utilised to prepare the data and to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) are "01-data-preparation-css.Rmd" and "02-EDA.Rmd".
